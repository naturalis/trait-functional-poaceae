## Data
This directory stores the data used in the statistical workflow, some of which
was generated by the two shell scripts in the [`/scripts`](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-functional-poaceae/tree/main/scripts)
directory.

### `*_traits.csv`
The `poaceae_traits.csv` and `poales_traits.csv` files were generated by the
[`traitAnalyser.sh`](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-functional-poaceae/blob/main/scripts/traitAnalyser.sh)
script in the [`/scripts`](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-functional-poaceae/tree/main/scripts)
directory. This file contains a table of traits with the following column data:
1. `trait`: This contains the name of the trait (or predicate) as listed on the EoL.
2. `total_occurrence`: Some organism entries may have multiple records of a single trait. This column contains the cumulative count of these.
3. `unique_occurrence`: Unlike `total_occurrence`, this column stores one for every trait an organism has, and is **not** cumulative.
4. `uri`: This has the URI address where the EoL has retrieved this data from.
5. `definition`: The definition of the trait, as defined by the ontology, is stored here.
6. `comment`: An optional note added by the EoL curators.

### `*_seedmasses.csv`
The files `poaceae_seedmasses.csv` and `poales_seedmasses.csv` were generated by
the [`traitGetData.sh`](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-functional-poaceae/blob/main/scripts/traitGetData.sh)
file from the [`/scripts`](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-functional-poaceae/tree/main/scripts)
directory. This file contains a list of species with seed mass data following these columns:
1. `id`: The EOL Page ID of an organism.
2. `organism`: This column contains the scientific name of the organism.
3. `trait`: This contains the name of the trait (or predicate) as listed on the EoL.
4. `measurement`: The value of the measurement of Seed Dry Mass is stored here.
5. `unit`: The unit the measurement in column 3 is recorded in.
6. `source`: The source of the trait data.

### `raw_means.csv`
This file contains a table of environmental variables for many angiosperm species.
This data was sourced from [another study](https://github.com/naturalis/angiosperm-traits)
by Esther de Regt and can be found [here](https://github.com/naturalis/angiosperm-traits/blob/master/raw_means.csv).
For convenience, it was downloaded to this directory as well.

### Phylogenetic Tree
Because the seed mass of grasses did not evolve independently, but based on ancestry,
a phylogenetic tree is required to keep evolutionary signal in mind. The tree used
is by [Smith and Brown from 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1019).
The specific tree used from this study is the `ALLMB.tre` and can be found in `Smith_Brown/v0.1/ALLMB.tre`.
